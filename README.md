there is some gotchas related with versions of libraries

because in three library after version 153, SphereBufferGeometry, BoxBufferGeometry ... and


others figures with buffer, was removed, so i keep this version along with the latest versions of
theatre and r3f 
so the config is 

`three 153` , `@react-three/fiber latest` `@theatre/r3f latest`
